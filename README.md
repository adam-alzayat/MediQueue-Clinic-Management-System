# MediQueue

MediQueue is a frontend-only MVP for a smart clinic booking, queue, and management platform. It is built as a realistic healthcare SaaS interface for a Computer Science portfolio project, using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, mock data, and localStorage.

## System Architecture Overview

- `assets/js/data.js` contains mock data for doctors, patients, services, appointments, queue entries, notifications, expenses, payroll, and booking slots.
- `assets/js/app.js` contains shared frontend logic for rendering dashboards, calculating analytics, checking booking capacity, sorting queue entries, handling notifications, and saving localStorage state.
- `assets/css/style.css` contains the responsive design system shared across all public pages and dashboards.
- HTML pages act as static view layers connected through shared frontend scripts and browser storage.

## localStorage Usage

The application stores simulated data locally for:

- Bookings
- Queue entries
- Doctor notes
- Completed appointments
- Notifications
- Expenses
- Payroll status
- Platform customization settings
- Queue preview state
- Activity logs
